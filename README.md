# Star Field

This is a 'star field' created with 3D computer graphics using WebGL and the Three.js library. I followed a tutroial and customised it to add colour to the stars and change their speed.

Move your mouse to trigger the star field. Move your mouse around to experiment with the speed of the stars.
